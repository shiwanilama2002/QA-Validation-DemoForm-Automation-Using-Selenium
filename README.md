# QA-Validation-DemoForm-Automation-Using-Selenium
This project serves as a practical exercise in automation, where I've implemented Selenium to automate interactions with a demo website. Leveraging Selenium's capabilities, I've automated various elements including text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and select buttons, covering a broad spectrum of user inputs.Moreover, the implementation incorporates features like scrolling and explicit waits, ensuring seamless navigation and robust validation of dynamic web elements.
